Use pointer/button motion event instead of XQueryPointer every frame.
Use directional audio when using mpv.
Dynamically load mpv (with dlopen) when using the --video option instead of linking to it at compile time.
Show mpv gui.
Allow setting/changing video at runtime.
Automatically use the right vr option when using mpv by looking at the file name (or file metadata?). There is a standard in filenames to specify the vr format.
Make stereo audio follow headset rotation in 180/360 mode (assume facing forward is the default audio mode).
Fix sphere360... AAAAAA.
Use egl instead of glx for xcomposite window capture because nvidia glx has a limitation where only 1 pixmap can be created for a window which means that with some compositors (gnome for example with CSD or picom in GLX mode) it will fail to create a texture and the captured texture will instead be black. Nvidia with egl doesn't have this limitation.
Add option to capture monitors. This would be useful specifically with the --overlay option.
Allow selecting window/monitor in overlay.
Use lanczos resampling shader for improved texture quality.
